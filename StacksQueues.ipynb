    "    * Keep track of the max/min in a new stack. \n",
    "    * If there are duplicates, keep track of the count in the aux stack\n",
    "    * At every push/pop, the top of stack represents the max/min\n",

    "2. Implement Queue with max/min\n",
    "    * Use a separate ds to track max. This ds will store max elements from left to right.\n",

    "    * To dequeue -> If leftmost element = removed element, remove it from the ds.\n",
